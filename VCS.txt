The Virtual Control System Environment (VCSE) is
a modeling and simulation tool for Process Control
Systems (PCS) that is being developed to address the
following issues in the Roadmap to Secure Control
Systems [1]:
? Measure and assess security posture for facility
providers. The goal is that by 2008, 50% of
asset owners and operators can perform selfassessments of their control systems using
consistent criteria.
? Develop and integrate protective measures for
PCS. The goal is to provide “security test
harnesses” for evaluating next generation
architectures and individual PCS components by
2014.
The first goal is challenging because insufficient
tools and techniques currently exist to measure risk. In
addition, the threats are hard to demonstrate and quantify.
A VCSE-like tool may help an analyst determine the
robustness of a system’s security posture by performing
analysis on a modeled PCS and its controlled
infrastructures. In most cases, an on-line operational
system cannot be stressed by introducing attacks or
failures to measure the system’s resilience.
